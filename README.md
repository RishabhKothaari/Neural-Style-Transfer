Artistic style transfer using convolution neural network

### About

Deep neural networks have demonstrated a near-human performance in the areas of object detection
and face recognition. However, these networks have never been used to create images which look and
feel like artistic images. This research introduced by [Leon A.Gatys et.al](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) is a novel articial system based on a deep neural network
that creates artistic images using neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of
arbitrary images. It relies on the fact that when convolutional neural networks are trained on object
recognition, they develop an abstract representation of image that makes object information
increasingly explicit along the processing hierarchy.
This [repository](https://github.com/rishab-pdx/Neural-Style-Transfer) contains re-implementaion of artistic style transfer with PyTorch on Google colab as stated by [Leon A.Gatys et.al](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in their research.

### Implementation
